This project was created to showcase my animation and front-end skills.

The colors, animations, and transitions are inspired by some of the most well used software, applications and websites.

All of the animations in this project were created with [framer-motion], a rich and powerful ReactJS Animation library.(https://www.framer.com/motion/)
